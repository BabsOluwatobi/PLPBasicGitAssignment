# PLPBasicGitAssignment

I signed in my Github account , after which i created a new repo with a README.md file

i created a local folder, and initialized git in it using "git init" command.
i created a new file named 'hello.txt' using "git echo" command.
I staged it and commit it using "git add" and "git commit -m " commands respectively.
i pushed it to my github repo using "git push" into a new branch.
